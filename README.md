# Data_Wrangling

## The goal is to do data wrangling on the data.

The data is educational and fake.

We want to manage missing values in the data.
We have three methods.:
 1. Delete all missing values
 2. average for missing values
 3. MOD for missing values

## We use the average method for categorical data.
## We use the MOD method for numerical data
